# For GitHub projects you can use the tags or releases page.  Since the archive
# URLs use only the version as the name, it is recommended to use a

opts="filenamemangle=s/(?:.*)?v?(\d[\d\.-]*)\.tar\.gz/lua-httpclient-$1.tar.gz/" \
    https://github.com/hoelzro/lua-linenoise/tags (?:.*/)?v?(\d[\d\.-]*)\.tar\.gz
